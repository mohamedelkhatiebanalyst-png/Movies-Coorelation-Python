🎬 Movies Data Correlation Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores correlations between key variables in the movie industry to understand what factors most influence a movie’s financial success.
Using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, the project investigates relationships between budget, gross revenue, ratings, votes, and release year.

The goal is to move beyond assumptions and use data to identify which features truly matter.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze correlations between numerical movie features

Identify factors that influence box office revenue

Visualize relationships using clear and interpretable plots

Practice real-world data cleaning and EDA techniques

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

Movie dataset containing information such as:

Budget

Gross revenue

Rating

Votes

Release year

Company

The dataset was cleaned to:

Handle missing values

Convert data types

Encode categorical variables for correlation analysis

🔍 Key Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning

Removed missing values

Converted data types for accurate analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis

Scatter plots to visualize relationships

Correlation matrices for numeric features

Heatmaps for easy interpretation

Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation used to measure linear relationships

Focus on identifying strong positive or negative correlations

📈 Key Insights

Budget has a strong positive correlation with gross revenue

Votes correlate more strongly with gross revenue than ratings

Movie ratings alone are not reliable predictors of financial success

Production company influence is weaker than expected when encoded numerically

🧠 Conclusion

The analysis shows that financial and popularity-based factors (budget and votes) are stronger predictors of movie success than audience ratings alone.
This highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in the entertainment industry.
